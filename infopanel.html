        <h2>What do I see?</h2>
        <p>
          You can see the commute distance lines between work location and home
          location. The current dataset is limited to all Census blocks which
          contain 1,000 to 15,000 employees. The data is filtered to only
          include employees that travel at least 24,000 meters (roughly 15
          miles). The commute distance is also filtered on the high end to
          remove those telecommuters or work for an organization in another part
          of the country. The high end limit for a commute distance is set to
          100,000 meters or 62 miles. All distances are calculated as the most
          direct path between the two points. Travel distances therefore may be
          greater depending on the available highway routes between locations.
          <br /><br />The map is pre-set to display the commute lines for all
          employees within the dataset that are between the ages of 14 - 29 years.
        </p>
        <h2>What can I do?</h2>
        <p>
          You can pan and zoom in the usual ways. The controls at the top right
          let you show and hide different map layers: Age Ranges, Earnings
          Level, and Industry Type. The Show option allows for turning on and
          off the map labels.
        </p>
        <h2>What useful purpose does the map serve?</h2>
        <p>
          Commuting patterns and workplace employment data have a broad interest
          group including urban and regional planners, social science and
          transportation researchers, and businesses.<br /><br />
          As a technical accomplishment the project highlights the ability to
          aggregate a large amount of data and display the data within the
          constraining environment of the web browser.
        </p>
        <h2>What do the 3 colors represent?</h2>
        <p>
          The colors show the 3 distance ranges of commute to work lengths. The
          ranges are divided almost evenly across all 3 layer categories.<br />
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The orange color depicts long commutes. Any distance above 28 miles.
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>
            The blue color depicts medium commuters. A distance less than 28
            miles and 20 or more miles between the workplace and home residence.
          </li>
          <li>
            The white lines represent short commutes. Short commutes are
            distances between 9 and 20 miles.
          </li>
        </ul>
