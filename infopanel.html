      <h2>What do I see?</h2>
      <p>
        You can see the commute distance lines between work location and home
        location. The current dataset is limited to work location Census blocks which
        contain 1,000 to 15,000 employees. The data is filtered to only
        include employees that travel at least 24,000 meters (roughly 15
        miles). The commute distance is also filtered on the high end to
        remove telecommuters. The high end limit for a commute distance is set to
        100,000 meters or 62 miles. All distances are calculated as the most
        direct path between the two points. Travel distances therefore may be
        greater depending on the available highway routes between locations.
        <br /><br />The map is pre-set to display the commute lines for all
        employees within the dataset that are between the ages of 14 - 29 years.
      </p>
      <h2>What can I do?</h2>
      <p>
        You can pan and zoom in the usual ways. The controls at the top right
        let you show and hide different map layers: Age Ranges, Earnings
        Level, and Industry Type. The Show option allows for turning on and
        off the background map and location labels.
      </p>
      <h2>What useful purpose does the map serve?</h2>
      <p>
        Residence to workplace employment commute data have a broad interest
        group including urban and regional planners, social science and
        transportation researchers, businesses, and emergency management and assessment.
      </p>
      <h2>What do the 3 colors represent?</h2>
      <p>
        The colors show the 3 distance ranges of commute to work lengths. The
        ranges are divided almost evenly across all 3 layer categories. Distance is derived from straight line
        calculation between the workplace and residence locations.<br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The orange color depicts long commutes. Any distance greater than 28 miles.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          The blue color depicts medium commuters. A distance less than 28
          miles and 20 or more miles between the workplace and home residence.
        </li>
        <li>
          The white lines represent short commutes. Short commutes are
          distances between 15 and 20 miles.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What do the 3 earnings levels define?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Low represents earnings less than $1,250 per month.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          Medium represents earnings between $1,251 and $3,333 per month.
        </li>
        <li>
          High represents earnings greater than $3,333 per month.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Where did you get the data?</h2>
      <p>
        The data is sourced completely from the Census Bureau. Specifically the <a
          href="https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/#lodes">LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES)</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>How was the map created?</h2>
      <p>
        The LODES data is processed and assimilated into geospatial files using Python. The geospatial data is
        transitioned into vector tiles using Tippecanoe. The tiles are stored on Mapbox. Leaflet is the main driver of
        the map utilizing Leaflet Vectorgrid to display the tile sets stored on Mapbox.

The LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) data series, helps users understand, analyze, and visualize where people work and where workers live. 

The LODES data set is compiled from a variety of sources, including unemployment insurance earnings data, the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, and a number of other censuses and surveys.

Main: Jobs of workers who are employed in the state and reside in the state.
