## Spatial Patterns in Commute to Workplace
#### Using Census Bureau LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics
****

#### I. Introduction  

This project is about discovering new insight into the communities in which we live and the communities where we work. Some cities of the United States have already seen a transformation of becoming the location of peoples residence as well as the location of their work. This is a significant shift from 20 years ago when some predicted that commuting to work would be a thing of the past with the advent of the Internet. 'Everyone would work from home' is what the prognosticators told us. However, that has not happened and parts of the country experience commute times well over an hour. The intention of the project is to devise a process to capture data from the census data and produce maps that provide insight into the commute patterns between residence and workplace. 

Commuting patterns and workplace employment data have a broad interest group including urban and regional planners, social science and transportation researchers, and businesses.
